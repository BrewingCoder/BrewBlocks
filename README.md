# Brewer's Blocks and Utilities

See the [Wiki (WIP)](https://github.com/BrewingCoder/BrewBlocks/wiki) For Detailed Descriptions of all the included items.

Firstly, Thank you to all the other mod developers that license their mods with Open Source
Licenses.  Without you I would never learn the things I need to learn in order to make mods the
way I want.  There are a few key mods in which I scour,copy,paste and revise when building this mod.

These guys are the bomb: Omwii (Powah/Lollipop), 
BlakeBr0 (Mystical Agriculture), and cjm721 (Overloaded). And, for the record,
 my library is based on Lollipop which is some of the cleanest mod code I think I've ever had the privilege of reading and emulating.
 
 ### ChangeLog
 
` 1.0.1 - Added Night Vision Goggles`

 `1.0.0 - Initial Release ` 
  
  ### Note on Textures and Licensing
  Yes, the textures I use are 64x which is much higher resolution than the 16x of vanilla Minecraft.  However 
  I feel that while the textures are 64x they are clean and traditional and fit in 
  very well even when used in a vanilla minecraft experience without other texture packs.  
  
  I will be working on a 16x variant data-pack that can be applied over the mod for those who
  are absolutely dead-set on 16x.
  
  Also, the textures are based on textures found in the original Soar49's Soartex texture pack
  whose license can be found [here](https://soartex.net/license/).
