Some textures in the mod were either sourced from, or modified from the Original Soartex 1.2.5 Ported texture pack released to the public domain in November of 2011.

IMHO this, and it's continuation as Soartex Fanver, is one of the greatest texture packs made for Minecraft.  I only wish that they would either a) continue thier work on the project (no movement in two years) or b) release the license on the newer work.

Their use within this pack is based on the license detailed here:
